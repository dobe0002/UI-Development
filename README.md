# UI Development Fundamentals

Series of short ~30 minute sessions to introduce the OIT - Application Development group to newer UI development ideas. Each session explores a single or two tightly related topics.

Each session will also provide "next step" that can be done immediately as work is done on applications.

## Goals of sessions:

- Team(s) are using the same language to discuss UI issues.
- Team(s) members have enough knowledge to explore UI development topics on their own.
- Team(s) members can provide input and guide UI development road map.
- Organically create a team standard of how UI development is done.
